The version of Recast is based on commit 57610fa6ef31b39020231906f8c5d40eaa8294ae (date: 21 Oct 2019) from repository
https://github.com/recastnavigation/recastnavigation
Only 'Recast' folder is necessary. File CMakeLists.txt has been modified.

Library was copied directly from recastnavigation repository therefore modifications stated in "extern/recastnavigation/readme-blender.txt" in blender's source were lost.
